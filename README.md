# Climate analysis and data exploration from climate database

### 1. Precipitation Analysis
* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of precipitation data.
* Select only the date and prcp values.
* Load the query results into a Pandas DataFrame and set the index to the date column.
* Sort the DataFrame values by date.
* Plot the results using the DataFrame plot method.

### 2. Station Analysis
* Design a query to calculate the total number of stations.
* Design a query to find the most active stations.
* List the stations and observation counts in descending order.
* Which station has the highest number of observations?
* Design a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (tobs).
* Filter by the station with the highest number of observations.

### 3. Temperature Analysis of my Trip : 12-27-2015 to 01-10-2016
* Use the calc_temps function to calculate the min, avg, and max temperatures for your trip 
* Plot the min, avg, and max temperature from your previous query as a bar chart.

### 4. Rainfall per Weather Station
* Design a query to calculate the total amount of precipitaion for the most popular station
